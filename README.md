# Ember-deploy-s3-index

This is the S3-adapter implementation to use [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3) with
[ember-deploy](https://github.com/levelbossmike/ember-deploy), for index page management rather than asset management. For S3 managed assets the default adapter already exists [here](https://github.com/LevelbossMike/ember-deploy-s3).
